# Homework - Hello World

This assignment is very simple, and will mostly serve as a way to practice submitting homework to Gradescope.

## Complete hello_world

Inside *my_functions.cpp*, you'll find a single function: `int hello_world();`.
Complete the function so it does the following things:

1. Uses `cout` to print the string *Hello, world!* exactly.

2. Returns the value `23`.

Once you have finished the function run `make` to see a list of available make options,
	then run `make tests` to run unit tests locally on your machine.

If you have not scored 100%, carefully inspect the output of the unit tests to understand what your changes need to be.

Once you've scored 100% on the unit tests, you're ready for the next part.

## README.md

You'll need to create a file named *README.md* inside the repository, with information about yourself.
The information inside your *README.md* file must be formatted precisely. Use the *Code Submission Guidelines* document to find detailed instructions for the contents of this file.
After Gradescope grades your submission, you can inspect its output for clues to gain a perfect score on this part of the assignment, if you did not immediately earn full credit.

## Finished

Once you've earned a 100% score within Gradescope for this assignment,
	you're done. Hopefully, this was an easy practice assignment!
